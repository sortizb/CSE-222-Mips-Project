# Computer Architecture Project - Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal Converter

This project is part of the CSE-222: Computer Architecture course and aims to demonstrate a deep understanding of the MIPS/Assembly programming language. The project focuses on creating a program that can convert numbers between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations. Users can input any of these three formats, and the program provides the number in the the three representations, including user's input.

## Project Description

The Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal Converter is designed to assist users in converting numbers between different numerical bases: decimal, binary, and hexadecimal. This tool is invaluable for understanding and practicing numeric conversions within the context of computer architecture.

## Features

- Conversion from decimal to binary and hexadecimal
- Conversion from binary to decimal and hexadecimal
- Conversion from hexadecimal to decimal and binary
- Console interface for input and output

## Technologies Used

- MIPS/Assembly

## Language

- **MIPS/Assembly:** The primary programming language used for this project.
